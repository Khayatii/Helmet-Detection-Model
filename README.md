# HELMET DETECTION MODEL
This helmet detection system is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance safety enforcement in various environments, including construction sites, manufacturing facilities, and sports arenas. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system accurately identifies individuals who are not wearing helmets in real-time.

By seamlessly integrating with existing surveillance infrastructure, this system provides instantaneous alerts to personnel or authorities, enabling prompt intervention to ensure compliance with safety regulations. With its ability to process video feeds in real-time, the system offers a proactive approach to safety enforcement, mitigating the risk of head injuries and fatalities in hazardous environments.

This solution not only improves safety protocols but also streamlines monitoring efforts, reducing the burden on human resources and enhancing overall operational efficiency. With its robust performance and adaptable architecture, this helmet detection system represents a crucial step towards creating safer workplaces and public spaces.
